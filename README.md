# Payment Gateway API

Welcome to the Payment Gateway API solution! This project is designed with scalability, maintainability, and robustness in mind, employing a suite of modern engineering practices and a strong architectural foundation.

## ‚ú® Key Architectural Decisions

- **Clean Architecture**  
  Adheres to Clean Architecture principles, ensuring that the core business logic is isolated from external concerns like data access and framework dependencies. This separation keeps this application flexible, testable, and resilient to change.

- **Project Structure**  
  The codebase is organized into clear layers:
    - **API Layer**: ASP.NET Core Web API, handles HTTP requests, validation, and API documentation.
    - **Application Layer**: Encapsulates business logic, use cases, and domain services.
    - **Infrastructure Layers**: Manages communication with databases, external services, and other technical concerns.

## üöÄ Features

- **API Versioning**  
  Supports multiple API versions for seamless, non-breaking evolution over time.

- **Idempotency Support**  
  Guarantees safe retries and protects against duplicate processing‚Äîcritical in payment systems.

- **Resilience with Polly**  
  Implements advanced resilience patterns (such as retries and circuit breakers) using Polly to ensure reliable integration with external systems.

- **Structured Logging**  
  Integrated with Serilog for rich, structured, and high-performance logging.

- **Comprehensive Testing**
    - **Unit Tests**: Validate business rules and application logic in isolation.
    - **Integration Tests**: Ensure end-to-end reliability and catch integration issues early.
    - All tests are built with xUnit and NSubstitute for robust, automated verification.

## üèóÔ∏è Quality & Maintainability

- **Modular and Independent Layers**: Each layer is independent, which makes the codebase easy to extend and refactor.
- **Best Practices**: Applies industry best practices for error handling, logging, configuration, and dependency management.
- **Well-Documented**: Committed to generating useful XML documentation and keeping the codebase approachable for contributors.
